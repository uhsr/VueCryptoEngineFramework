# VueCryptoEngineFramework

## Description

A Rust-based cryptocurrency library providing zero-knowledge proof integration via Bulletproofs for confidential transactions, utilizing a custom Merkle tree implementation optimized for memory efficiency on embedded systems.

## Features

- Integrate hardware security modules (HSMs) for secure key storage and cryptographic operations.
- Implement advanced encryption standard (AES) with Galois/Counter Mode (GCM) for authenticated encryption.
- Utilize WebAssembly (WASM) to optimize computationally intensive cryptographic algorithms for improved performance in the browser.
- Provide a component for generating and managing cryptographic keys using the Web Crypto API.
- Implement elliptic-curve DiffieHellman (ECDH) key exchange protocol for secure communication.
- Support various hashing algorithms, including SHA-256, SHA-384, and SHA-512, with configurable output lengths.
- Enable digital signature verification using RSA with Probabilistic Signature Scheme (PSS) padding.
- Offer a Vue composable for securely storing and retrieving cryptographic keys using IndexedDB with encryption at rest.
